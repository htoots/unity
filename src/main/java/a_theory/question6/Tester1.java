    // Performance testing
    // Performance testing is a process for finding out the responsiveness, stability and speed of (in our case) a
    //  computer program. Possible performance testing can also include stress testing, making sure the code is
    //  working as intended under a bigger load, and confirming no slowdowns caused by algorithms in the code exist.
    //  If any bottlenecks are discovered, the issues can be resolved by performance engineering.

    //todo p2
    // Second. Write the definition and explain what is it.
    // Sanity testing
    // Sanity testing is a process for confirming latest builds' code. Instead of testing the whole codebase, you
    //  confirm that every new addition is working as intended. The purpose of this type of testing is to quickly conclude
    //  if a new proposed build is working. This helps cut down on testing time and also costs of more rigorous testing.
