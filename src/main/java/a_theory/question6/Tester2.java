    // Regresssion Testing
    /*
    Regression testing is making sure that after a fix or a change, the software is still working as expected.
    Sometimes fixing a bug may cause another bug on a different part of the software, for example if there is a
    bug in the method that one of the attributes from a class is not populated correctly, once this bug is fixed it may
    be found that another method is not able to parse/read the new value returned from this method and it was not
    discovered before as this value was not being returned properly before as there was a bug.
    Regression test plays an important role in such scenarios to find the issues arising after a change in the software.

    // Load Testing
    /*
    Load testing is used to trigger/mimic a usage of expected amount of users on the system. While doing this, it is
    used to observe the performance of the system and the servers, it is to make sure that system will be able to
    operate fully with expected usage from all users. It is a helpful test method to find if there is a piece of
    code or service which is not able to handle or perform poorly under expected usage.
