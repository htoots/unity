    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Applications being built, tested and prepared for public release.

    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Continuous code changes being automatically built, tested and prepared for production.

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [x] test
    // [x] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 Teams are less pressurised to coordinate big changes due to smaller changes being automatically deployed
    //      to production.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // 1 Initial complexities are difficult to grasp and are not as beneficial as spending time focused on
    //      another part of the project.

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // CI/CD: CI
    // Because: As code becomes more complex, making sure it works as intended through tests becomes increasingly
    //              important. Code should be frequently checked to be error free. Building and automatically
    //              pushing latest changes to production is not the smartest move in the IT world and is
    //              usually avoided.
