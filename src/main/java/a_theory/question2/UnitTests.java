    // What are unit tests? In your words (don't use wiki definitions)
    // Answer: Automated tests for validation of individual parts/units of your code

    //todo p2
    // Name 2 benefits of unit tests
    // 1 Code is more reusable/modular as a result
    // 2 Debugging is easier than testing by hand

    //todo p3
    // Name 1 disadvantage of unit tests
    // 1 If your code evolves over time you need to keep remaking your tests and investing more and more time into rewriting tests
    //      instead of rewriting the code.

    //todo p4
    // Name 2 unit test frameworks or libraries
    // 1 JUnit
    // 2 Jtest

    //todo p5
    // Would you use mocking with unit tests?
    // Yes/No: Yes
    // Why? Mocking eliminates the use of external dependencies, allowing you to test your code freely without being
    //      dependant on code from other classes.
