    //todo A
    // What is DBaaS (Database as a service)?
    // Answer: DBaaS refers to software that helps users setup, operate and scale databases using common sets of
    //          understanding, instead of having to learn the exact implementation of that certain database

    //todo B
    // Name 2 examples of DBaaS.
    // 1 RDS
    // 2 SimpleDB

    //todo C
    // Name and explain 2 benefits of using DBaaS
    // 1 Developers are more agile, only having to understand the baseline understandings instead of complex facts
    //      of the database system.
    // 2 Modern DBaaS are easy to set up and run at a high performance. Systems automatically reroute traffic
    //      to replicas. In short, they have strong failsafes, are secure and fast.

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of using DBaaS
    // 1 No direct access control to databases.

    //todo E
    // What other -aaS do you know?
    // 1 DaaS (Data)
    // 2 DRaaS (Disaster Recovery)
    // 3 CaaS (Country)

    //todo F
    // In your opinion which aaS are the most useful and should be integrated first.
    // Answer:  DaaS. Centralising data in the cloud can be accessed easily and analysed everywhere.
    //          DRaaS. Allows an organisation to back up its data and IT structure in a third party cloud computing
    //                  environment. Allows regaining of access and functionality in case of errors or failures.
